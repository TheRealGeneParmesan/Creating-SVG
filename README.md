##Usage

- For this project I created a Shape class with subclasses of Circle, Square and Triangle
- The Circle, Square and Triangle sublcasses inherited the properties and method of the Shape class
- I exported and tested the Circle, Square and Triangle methods with Jest to make sure that everything passed
- I then imported everything from the Shapes.js folder into my Index.js folder and generated an SVG using the Inquirer package 
- When the script runs, the user is prompted with a series of questions asking and then based on the user's responses, an SVG file is created with the user's answered shape, color and characters (up to 3 letters).
